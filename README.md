# GTFS-viz
We like to help cities understand their public transportation system. For this we take the [GTFS dataset](https://github.com/allyapp/GTFS-viz/tree/master/data) of Mexico City and build software around the data to make it more accessible. 

There are different options to make the data more accessible and give a city insights in it's system:

### 1. Visualize the entire system
Show how the different modes of transport interact over time. To get an inspiration have a look at [this example](http://tracker.geops.ch/?z=14&s=1&x=-8235743.4976&y=4971840.9526&l=transport).

### 2. Query specific parts of the system
Give the city the option to query specific parts of their system (e.g. Bus 210) and get information about it. To get an inspiration have a look at [this example](https://transit.land/playground/).
Visualizing the results of the query is not necessary required. An API endpoint could be enough.

### 3. Build something out of the data
Feel free to build something out of the GTFS dataset that you think would help a city. You can be creative, there are no limitations.

### General instructions
* Please pick one of the three options.
* You can convert the GTFS data in a way convenient to you. There is no predefined way. 
* The examples should just serve as inspiration. Your solution does not need to be this advanced.
* The solution should work independently of the given GTFS dataset.
* Use this repository to build your solution.
* Don't forget the instructions for testing and running the code.
